an old silent pond ...
a frog jumps into the pond,
splash ! silence again .
=
over the wintry
forest , winds howl in party
with no leaves to blow .
=
liquid little stones
skipping and skittering free
on shared umbrellas
=
soft wind music plays                                                                            
on last harp strings of sun rays
clouds waltz in the sky
=
spring wakens my tree --
a bejeweled perfumed bride ...
love birds make their nest
=
fallâ€™s quick change artist --
from green to gold to crimson ...
disrobed , my tree naps
=
linear water ,
multivariable wind ,
accumulation
