an old silent pond ...
a frog jumps into the pond,
splash ! silence again .
=
over the wintry
forest , winds howl in party
with no leaves to blow .
=
liquid little stones
skipping and skittering free
on shared umbrellas
=
soft wind music plays                                                                            
on last harp strings of sun rays
clouds waltz in the sky
=
spring wakens my tree --
a bejeweled perfumed bride ...
love birds make their nest
=
fallâ€™s quick change artist --
from green to gold to crimson ...
disrobed , my tree naps
=
linear water ,
multivariable wind ,
accumulation
=
In the cicada's cry
a powerful wind embraces
the ancient cedars .
=
First autumn morning
the mirror I stare into
shows my father's face .
=
A lovely thing to see ...
through the paper window's hole ,
the Galaxy .
=
Experimenting ...
I hung the moon on various
branches of the pine .
=
moon in the cold --
only my own footsteps
on the bridge .
=
Will we meet again
Here at your flowering grave --
Two white butterflies ?
=
Dead my old fine hopes
And dry my dreaming but still ...
Iris , blue each spring .
=
My life --
How much more of it remains ? 
The night is brief .
=
Green frog ,
Is your body also
freshly painted ?
=
From a bathing tub
I throw water into the lake --
slight muddiness appears .
=
Night , and the moon !
My neighbor, playing on his flute --
out of tune !
=
First autumn morning ...
the mirror I stare into
shows my father's face .
=
The moment two bubbles
are united , they both vanish.
A lotus blooms .
=
You rice-field maidens !
The only things not muddy
Are the songs you sing .
=
I want to sleep
Swat the flies
Softly , please .
=
A dead chrysanthemum
and yet -- isn't there still something
remaining in it ?
=
The flap of a bat ,
drip drip of monsoon waters .
Ancient image stares .
=
Behold the ego
Set in glowing emptiness
On the edge of time
